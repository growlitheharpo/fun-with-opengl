h1. Fun with OpenGL

This is a repo I've been working in for a long time now. It's never been a project with a final goal in mind. Instead, it's geared towards trying things out that I'm currently interested in, inside of a framework that's small enough to support that without having to make huge architecture decisions or changes.

For instance, it's been, at times:
* A rudimentary OpenGL renderer (never got past the 2D triangle stage)
* A playground for working with NuGet
* A place to learn about templates and constexpr
* An implementation of the C++ std::vector, plus iterators and allocators (sort of--never got around to making allocators work in a standards-compliant way)
